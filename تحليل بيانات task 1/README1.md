# Naive Bayes Classifier
The heart disease data used in this task was taken from Kaggle ( "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset"). 
Initially, the Pandas library was imported to run the Python code, and three models were used to predict whether a person has heart disease or not:
Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree model.
The accuracy achieved from the models is as follows:

Gaussian Naive Bayes: 80%
Multinomial Naive Bayes: 68.78%
Decision Tree model: 98.53%
What we concluded after using these models is that all models achieved high accuracy in predictions,
but the Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy,making it the best option. 
Meanwhile, the Multinomial Naive Bayes model needs someÂ improvements.
